 * \details
 *
 * This file is in charge of linking samples to their best match, traversing
 * all fields in epoch order. It uses PixelStore as sample container, and
 * use it to iterate over all pixels. The most important functions in this
 * file are the static functions "cross_sample" and "crossmatch".
 *
 * I've found that two fields and four samples are enought to represent all
 * cases I have identified and have to deal with. The problem is that the
 * order in wich matches are done, can leave unliked samples. These example
 * are high level, ignoring pixels, just talking about distance between samples
 * and ordering in time.
 *
 * Let's take this as a first work case with field1 an field2 sorted by epoch
 * (with field1 older) and four samples "a", "b",  "y" and "z":
 *
 * \code{.unparsed}
 * field2 ---y----x--------------
 * field1 ------a--b-------------
 * \endcode
 *
 * \par Case 1 (the fine case)
 * - "b" link "x" as his closest match,
 * - "a" link "y" as his closest match, (would have taken "x", but "x" have a
 * better  match with "b")
 * - we have iterated all field1 samples, this end here for this field.
 *
 * Everything is fine.
 *
 * \par Case 2 (a problem)
 * - "a" link "x" as his closest match, (better than "y"), then
 * - "b" link "x" as his closest match, (unlinking a->next bestmach)
 * - we have iterated all field1 samples, this end here for this field.
 *
 * In this case, "a" will never match "y" where he should.
 *
 * So when "b" is linking himself to "x", it must tell "a" (the previous "x"
 * match) to search a new match in upper fields. This is done in the new
 * algorythm as "CROSS_UP" option. In this case, "CROSS_UP" would just
 * add a new step after unlinking any sample->next match. Example:
 *
 * - "a" link "x" as his closest match, (better than "y"), then
 * - "b" link "x" as his closest match, (unlinking a->next bestmach)
 * - CROSS_UP "a": "a" link "y" as his closest match (and fail for "x"
 * because "b" is a better match for "x")
 * - we have iterated all field1 samples, this end here for this field.
 *
 * Fine.
 *
 * \par Case 3 (CROSS_UP is not enought)
 *
 * Another test case:
 * \code{.unparsed}
 * field2 -----y--x--------------
 * field1 ------a----b-----------
 * \endcode
 *
 * We use relink_up:
 * - "b" link "x" as his closest match, then
 * - "a" link "x" as his closest match, (unlinking b->next),
 * - relink_up(b) found no valid match (or any other "bad" match).
 * - "a" link "y" as his closest match, (it is better than "x") and unlink
 * him from x->prev.
 * - we have iterated all field1 samples, this end here for this field.
 *
 * In this case, "b" and "x" are not matching, when they should. Plus the
 * order in wich the matches have been done have deleted the relation between
 * "x" and "b", "relink_up" does not sove this.
 *
 * So, when "a" link to "y" and unlink from "x", it left "x" prevsamples
 * empty. We need to tell "x" to find a new match back in time. This is done
 * with the "CROSS_DOWN" logic in the new code.
 *
 * \par Case 4 (fine again)
 *
 * Here whith the use of "relink_up" and "relink_down", we have the expected
 * result in all cases:
 *
 * - "b" link "x" as his closest match, then
 * - "a" link "x" as his closest match, (unlink b->next)
 * - relink_up "b": found no valid match (or any other "bad" match),
 * - "a" link "y" as his closest match, (unlink x->prev)
 * - relink_down "x": found "b" as his closest match
 * - we have iterated all field1 samples, this end here for this field.
 *
 * Everything is fine, "a" matches "y" and "b" matches "x".
 *
 * Note that these steps can recurse, because they might unlink
 * other samples. So a simple crossmatch can recurse many times
 * change and relink many samples until it reaches a stable state.
